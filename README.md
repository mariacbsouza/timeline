# Timeline
This is a timeline with navigation and items arranged by date, with the goal of optimizing space on each line.

## Key Features
One of the main strengths of this implementation is the navigation, which provides a more focused and assertive view of the items.

## Future Improvements
If I were to rebuild this project, I would focus on the following enhancements:
- Re-evaluate the strategy for arranging items on the screen for better efficiency.
- Incorporate TypeScript to improve type safety and maintainability.
- Add full responsiveness to ensure the layout adapts seamlessly to mobile devices.
- Refactor the codebase by splitting the timeline into different components.
- To support the new component structure, implement a global state manager for shared data and actions.
- Introduce more navigation options within the header.
- Improve the tooltip to handle cases where the text content is too long.

## Testing Strategy
The quality of this application would be ensured through a comprehensive testing approach:
- Unit tests for core functions.
- Rendering tests for React components.
- End-to-End (e2e) tests to validate overall behavior and user flows.

## Design Inspiration
The design for this application was based on Airtable's new timeline view, which can be found here: https://blog.airtable.com/introducing-airtables-new-timeline-view/
